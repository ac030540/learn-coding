# Learn Coding

Learn Coding is a platform to learn programming. Currently, we support Python & Java programming languages.

## Why Learn Coding?
1. Giving teachers full control over the curriculum of programming: Learn Coding provides an admin portal over which teachers can visit and tweak the curriculum to best suit the needs of their students.
2. Focuses not just on programming skills but also on debugging skills: On every problem, students can enter into debugging mode which will load up a wrong answer to the problem which the student can fix and improve their debugging skills.
3. Structured learning: The learning process is divided into 3 parts - Beginner, Advanced & Expert. Students can pick any level based on their current skills.
